## Current Status
DATE: 11/01/2024-
The project is offically approved and we are tasked with breaking down the device into multitude of parts. 

DATE: 12/01/2024-
Intial parts list has been drafted; however, progress overall is slow due to pressure from school. 

DATE: 2/2/2025-
The parts of the project has been verified and is compatible with the microcontroller of choice. They will likely be ordered within a week. This allows us to take the time to research ardunio libraries to understanding programming each part of the design.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is construct a to develop a mobile electronic device that measure the air quality of an enclosed room. Data that is measured includes particulate matter, volatile organic compunds, carbon dixoide, temperaure, and humunity. After collecting this data through four sensors, real-time data as well as twenty-four hour data is displayed on a 3.5" LCD screen. This data is transmitted and recieved using a centralized mircrocontroller (R3 Arduino). 

## Educational Value Added

This project's most crucial educational value is understanding product prototyping using electronics. We first identified a problem and then outlined an essential design brief. The end goal was to create a device that addressed the issue of poor indoor air quality. By creating a device that monitors several parameters, the user can understand the air quality of their surrounding environment; therefore, the user can take the right action to prevent future problems. Once the device's schematic is finalized, the parts can be ordered, and the prototype can be created. Considering most data is transmitted digitally, the device will require programming in C. Something in itself that requires time and research. The final product would be to create an air quality monitor using a PCB, making it mobile. What initially started on paper will eventually become a physical PCB thanks to prototyping.  

## Tasks

WEEK FOLLOWING FEB. 2ND-
1. Update GH repository (L)
2. Submit parts list (L)
3. Draft new schematic of device (L)
4. Find an arduino library or similar reference material for each sensor (L/F)
5. Write pseudocode for each sensor connected to the device (F)
6. Write pseudocode for the LCD screen (F)

## Design Decisions

SENSORS-
The device will measure the following data:
1. Temperature
2. Humidity
3. VOC
4. CO2
5. PM

GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE-
I. The data measure will be displayed on an LCD screeN
II. LCD will have two menus for 24 hour and real time data
III. Touch screen simplfies user interface

DEVICE EXTERIOR-
I. The outer shell will be a 3D printed case with enough room for its electronics

## Design Misc.

PCB-
I. After the final build, the circuit using a breadboard can be converted into a PCB. 

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

DESIGNING DEVICE (A)
1. Create a brief design outline for the project
2. Recieve project approval
3. Draft an intial parts list
4. Finalize parts list
5. Order parts (CURRENTLY ON)

INTIAL PROTOTYPE (B)
7. Build the device using schematics
8. Program each part of the device
9. Test and revise until it performs as intended

FINAL PROTOTYPE (C)
11. Build a PCB for the circuit
12. Once the PCB is ordered, create the device's exterior
13. Build the final prototype
14. Complie a portfolio documenting the process that led to the final prototype
